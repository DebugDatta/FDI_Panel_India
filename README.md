# Sectoral FDI Analysis for India (2000–2024)

This repository contains the data and Python code used for the empirical analysis in the paper:

FDI Sensitivity to Macroeconomic, Financial and Policy Variables:  
A Multi-Sector Analysis for India (2000–2024)

The study examines how sector-level FDI inflows in India are associated with
macroeconomic conditions and major policy reforms.

## Data

The file `data/final_panel_dataset.csv` is a cleaned and balanced panel dataset
covering 10 sectors over the period 2000–2024. It includes sector-wise realised
FDI inflows, macroeconomic variables, and policy reform indicators.

---

## Methodology

The analysis uses fixed-effects panel regressions with sector and year fixed
effects. The dependent variable is specified as ln(FDI + 1). Macroeconomic
variables, lagged specifications, policy dummies, and sector × policy interaction
terms are used. Results are interpreted as associative, not causal.
